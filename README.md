# silverstripe-social-media-links

Allows the creation of social media links for output on your website. A simple module which outputs an un-ordered list with links to your social media pages.

### Requirements

- You will require font-awesome included in your project (only if you want the icons to work and aren't using your own custom ones).
- You will need to style this as there is none provided.

### Usage

All you need to do is include ```<% include SocialMedia %>``` in your template where you want the links to appear. You can customise the template if you want by copying it from the module directory to the equivelent directory in your theme.

###Support

*Note, this module was developed for personal use, experimentation and further learning and development. Please feel free to use it if you wish, but support for the module will be either non existant for the moment, or patchy at best.*

### Future Development

- add the ability to turn icons on or off (for those who aren't using font awesome or custom icons)
- include the template code to display customised uploaded icons (including sizing - this needs to be added to the Data Object).
